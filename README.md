# CHECKERS
The purpose of this project was to create a checkers game. With the classic game of checkers involving two separate players playing on an 8x8 board we set out to create a virtual version. Our project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing the user to play against another player or against a computer. HTML served as the basis of the board, and piece to help give the Web application a framework. Then CSS was added to help with our visual changes, and JavaScript handled the background and logic of the game. With three team members working on this project, used the GitHub version control platform to ensure that changes were going to be tracked and any edits can be managed, in that manner we were able to revert changes to their previous state and see at what point a change was made that broke the project so that we can fix it. This also allowed for better code reviews and enhanced teamwork. One advantage of using GitHub is the built-in testing, because of that any commits that were pushed were automatically tested so that we know right away if a commit will break the project.
